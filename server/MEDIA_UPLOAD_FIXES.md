# Media Upload System Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve issues with image/media uploads and cleanup in the application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Temporary Files Cleanup**

- **Problem**: Files uploaded to `public/uploads/temp` were not being cleaned up on errors
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive cleanup functions throughout the codebase
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `cleanupTempFiles()` helper function in controllers
  - Added error handling with cleanup in all upload operations
  - Added scheduled cleanup task for orphaned temp files

### 2. **Digital Ocean Spaces Integration**

- **Problem**: Images should go to Digital Ocean Spaces but weren't being properly handled
- **Solution**: Fixed upload flow and error handling
- **Implementation**:
  - Images first upload to `public/uploads/temp`
  - Then get processed and uploaded to Digital Ocean Spaces
  - Original temp files are automatically deleted after successful upload
  - On error, temp files are cleaned up immediately

### 3. **Post Deletion Media Cleanup**

- **Problem**: When posts were deleted, associated images weren't being removed from Digital Ocean Spaces
- **Solution**: Enhanced deletePost function
- **Implementation**:
  - Extract media keys from URLs
  - Delete main files and thumbnails from Digital Ocean Spaces
  - Use `Promise.allSettled()` to ensure DB deletion even if some files fail to delete

### 4. **Error Handling and Rollback**

- **Problem**: No proper rollback mechanism for failed operations
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling
- **Implementation**:
  - Track uploaded files during operations
  - Rollback uploaded files if database operations fail
  - Cleanup temp files in all error scenarios
  - Use try-catch blocks with proper cleanup

## Files Modified

### Controllers

- `server/src/controllers/postController.js`
  - Enhanced `createPost` with error handling and cleanup
  - Fixed `deletePost` to remove files from Digital Ocean Spaces
  - Improved `updatePost`, `uploadMedia`, and `deleteMedia` functions
- `server/src/controllers/mediaController.js`
  - Added temp file cleanup in all functions
  - Enhanced error handling with rollback mechanisms
  - Improved `uploadMedia`, `updateMedia`, and `deleteMedia` functions

### Utilities

- `server/src/utils/scheduledTasks.js`
  - Added `cleanupTempFiles()` function
  - Scheduled hourly cleanup of temp files older than 1 hour
  - Enhanced existing media cleanup task

## Upload Flow

### Successful Upload Flow

1. File uploaded to `public/uploads/temp` via multer
2. File processed and uploaded to Digital Ocean Spaces
3. Database record created
4. Temp file automatically deleted
5. Public URL returned to client

### Error Handling Flow

1. If upload to Digital Ocean Spaces fails:
   - Cleanup temp file
   - Return error to client
2. If database operation fails:

   - Delete uploaded file from Digital Ocean Spaces
   - Cleanup temp file
   - Return error to client

3. If any other error occurs:
   - Cleanup all temp files
   - Rollback any partial operations
   - Return error to client

## Scheduled Cleanup Tasks

### Media Cleanup (Daily at 3 AM)

- Removes orphaned media records older than 24 hours
- Deletes corresponding files from Digital Ocean Spaces

### Temp Files Cleanup (Every Hour)

- Removes temp files older than 1 hour
- Runs immediately on server startup

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these Digital Ocean Spaces variables are set:

```env
DO_SPACES_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
DO_SPACES_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DO_SPACES_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
DO_SPACES_REGION=your_region
DO_SPACES_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_url
```

## Benefits

1. **No Orphaned Files**: Temp files are automatically cleaned up
2. **Proper Error Handling**: All error scenarios are handled with cleanup
3. **Storage Management**: Digital Ocean Spaces files are properly managed
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Scheduled tasks prevent storage bloat
5. **Rollback Support**: Failed operations don't leave partial data

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Try uploading images to posts - should work normally
2. Simulate upload errors - temp files should be cleaned up
3. Delete posts with images - images should be removed from Digital Ocean Spaces
4. Check temp directory after failed uploads - should be clean
5. Monitor scheduled tasks in server logs
